title: Design Cisplatin Induced Hearing Loss Prediction User Interface with Shiny
description: A questionnaire-based website, developed using Shiny, is designed for patients to utilize the PedsHEAR model. This model classifies individuals into high-risk, intermediate-risk, or low-risk categories for developing communication-impacting hearing loss. Additionally, it provides the probability of occurrence along with the associated 95% confidence interval, offering valuable insights for risk assessment and decision-making.

## Basketball Player

I got the amazing chance to join the USC club basketball team while I was a graduate student at USC, and it turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. For me, basketball has always been more than simply a sport; it's a means of pushing my physical and mental limits and making connections with like-minded people.

    On the left, that’s me, wearing number 4, warming up with a big smile on my face. To be honest, I can’t even remember what I was laughing at—it could have been a teammate’s joke or just the pure joy of being on the court. On the right, it’s a snapshot from our first game of the 2021 season, a highly anticipated matchup against the UCLA club basketball team. It was an unforgettable game where we brought our A-game and secured a victory.

    I was so thrilled after the win that I posted an Instagram story with the admittedly outrageous caption, “Destroy UCLA.” Looking back, it makes me laugh at how bold and brash I was in those moments. It’s a reminder of how youthful exuberance sometimes takes over in the heat of excitement. These days, I approach such moments with a bit more humility, but I still cherish the memories and lessons from those times.

## Traveler and Photographer

I feel incredibly blessed to have had the opportunity to travel extensively and study across three continents, all thanks to the unwavering support of my beloved parents. My journey began in Dongguan, a vibrant city in southern China near Shenzhen and Hong Kong, where I spent the first 18 years of my life. After finishing high school, I chose to spread my wings and move to Nanjing for college. Though just a three-hour flight from home, it felt like the beginning of a new chapter—a small but significant step toward independence.

After earning my bachelor’s degree, my desire for academic and personal growth took me even farther from home—to Utrecht, Netherlands, where I pursued a master’s degree. Living in Europe was a transformative experience. During that period, I had the privilege of traveling to four incredible countries: the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, and Belgium. Each destination left a unique imprint on my soul. I embraced new cultures, tried unfamiliar cuisines, and connected with people whose perspectives enriched my own. These experiences opened my mind to the beauty of diversity and the shared humanity that transcends borders. I truly believe I left a part of my heart in Europe.

Eventually, my journey brought me to the United States. I flew from Amsterdam to Los Angeles to embark on yet another adventure—this time as a graduate student in Southern California. This marked a new chapter in my life, one filled with challenges, discoveries, and opportunities for growth.

Travel has been so much more than a way to see new places; it has shaped who I am. It has taught me to be adaptable, to appreciate differences, and to approach the world with curiosity and humility. Each journey has been a lesson in resilience, self-awareness, and gratitude. Traveling broadens horizons, but more importantly, it deepens the way we understand ourselves and the world around us. Looking back, I am deeply grateful for these experiences that have made me more open-minded, compassionate, and eager to embrace the unknown.
